# Time-Series-Analysis-for-Temperature-Forecasting-using-ARIMA-Model
I used ARIMA model which stands for "Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages".

In this case as the data is stationary therefore only AR and MA have been taken into account.

Then AIC is calculated and then I found values of p and q having lowest AIC where the p represents the number of Auto-Regressive (AR) terms and q represents the number of Moving Averages (MA) terms.
